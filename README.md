# About
In this project, I implement Dijkstra's algorithm using priority queue and hash map given in the assignment. This assignment was due on December 6th, 2022.

# Files:

1. ShortestPath.java (and CodeIWrote.java)

In this file, I worked on part of the run() method and all of the returnPath() method. My code is snapshot in CodeIWrote.java. I used Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph, and I used the concept of 'handles' to have access to each node and update their distance to the starting node.

2. DirectedGraph.java

An implementation of a directed graph.

3. Vertex.java

The class file for the Vertex object.

4. Edge.java

The class file for the Edge object.

5. VertexAndDist.java

The class file for the VertexAndDist object. Distance here refers to distance from a given node to the starting node.
